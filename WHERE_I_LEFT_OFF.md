# Where I left Off

## 22/09/24
- Ported landing page over to this project.
- Initialise Prismic Slice machine.
  - Can visit `/portfolio/hello-world`, however `/portfolio` itself isn't set up.

Next Steps
- Create a project page type in Prismic
- Port over content
- Create a landing page for `/portfolio`.
  - Singleton master document in Prismic, which links to each project as slice/repeatable zone?
